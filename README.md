# Antiplagiarism

This web page is a tool for checking any files for plagiarism. Two verification algorithms are implemented:

* Wagner-Fischer algorithm
* Shingle algorithm

## Algorithm information

If you are interested in the theory of these algorithms, you can find it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm) and [here](https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Shingle_Algorithm) for algorithms 1 and 2, respectively.

## Tools used in the project

The project was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Mostly functional components are used. The backend was written using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. Also, asynchronous information processing was used in the implementation of the Shingles algorithm.
